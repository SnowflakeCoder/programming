With reference to your application for the role for the Senior Java Role based out of Bangalore, we **request you to solve the problem statement** attached in the email as per the instructions given and upload your code in github and share the link to us for our technical team to evaluate and shortlist for the next rounds.

“Please reply to this mail with your code link”

### Design and implement a Loan Approval Platform (Car Loan)

1. It should implement KYC
2. As an end user, I should be able to apply for loan(online)
3. As a front officer, I should be able to validate the loan request and ask for approval from the car loan department and risk department
4. As an approving officer, I should be able to approve or reject the loan request
5. As a risk officer, I should be able to approve or reject a loan application and a risk officers’ decision is final and overrides any other approvers
6. Based on the final decision, a request should be send to disbursal department to disburse the money

###  What are you supposed to submit?

1. A documentation satisfying both functional, non-functional and extended requirements, assumptions in the form of markdown committed at GitHub
2. A working code with widgets (web components) and RESTful api with proper code quality measurements committed at github
3. Any extra feature that can create business value(optional)

###  How are we planning to evaluate?

1. Documentation

   1. We will be checking a lot of detailing about the solution for functional, non-functional and extended requirement along with options where ever applicable and why did you choose a specific solution from the various options. This will show how well you have understood the problem, how have you studied the various components and how did you evaluate a specific solution. Can you take a step ahead with docsify and gh-pages?
   2. Does the document talk about how to build start, test, and deploy locally as well as through automated tools?
   3. Does the document talk about system design and the various components involved?
   4. Does the document talk about various technical choices and decisions made through ADR?

2. RESTful API

   We will be checking how well you have designed your RESTful api and how much of the global standardization have you adopted.

3. Readable

   We write code not for machines to understand but for another contributor to understand and contribute. Format them well with a definite code style like google style guide.

4. Testable

   How well you have written tests with test pyramid. Are you following TDD or BDD approach? You commit will show what kind of approach you are following. The approach of TDD will generally include test along with production code.

5. Commit and commit message

   A good developer always makes incremental commits with meaningful commit message for helping other collaborators to back trace though commit message.

6. Quality

   How do you automate the quality checks of your code and make the reports available in terms of violations and code coverage. Failing fast is one of the key aspect that helps in delivering a software in agile. How do you help in failing fast and help deliver quality code.

7. CI\CD

   How have you automated your code to be compiled, tested, verified for quality and deployed. You can choose something like below

   1. Job runner: TravisCI/ Jenkins
   2. Coverage report: Sonar
   3. Quality report:
   4. Technology stack
      1. Java : You are free to use a language java or kotlin
      2. Framework: Spring, spring-boot, spring-cloud
