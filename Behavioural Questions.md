## Common Things

- In my previous company, we developed a **news application**, called NewsHunt / DailyHunt. We supported 20-30 languages.



## CUSTOMER OBSESSION

### Customer feedback

Give me an example of a time you used <u>customer feedback to drive improvement or innovation</u>. What was the situation and what action did you take?

- DailyHunt => We used to get customer <u>feedback about the news content</u>, like news are **fake, old news, wrong content, adult images, violence etc**. Its difficult to evaluate the news in the beginning because our <u>main goal is to get the news to customer first</u>. But we understood our <u>customer also expects us to deliver quality news</u>.
- To avoid such issues we first started using content from main publisher, assuming the news quality will be good. So we created a **premium list of publishers for each language**.
- First stage we **created a team called NET (News evaluation team**) and they only go through all the main headings and images and **remove the most obvious ones**. 
- Same time we develped a **feature which allows customer to tag news** as Fake, Old, Violence etc. We also started evaluating customer feedback on each news try to prioritise the issues, to understand which one to tackle first. So we designed an **ML algorithm which can find fake news and Old news**. Later we developed for Violence and adult content also.



### Most difficult customer interaction

Give me an example of your most difficult customer interaction and how you worked through it. What was the outcome? 

-  I have tried to resolve many customer problems in my career. I have worked on services like payment APIs, notifications (cricket , soccer messages),  Voucher services etc. 
- What I learned from is **Communication is always the key**. Its very normal that the **customer always expects better services**. You <u>always need to look out for your customers</u> no matter how big/small is the problem. My approach was always 1. Direct communication 2. Give them a small gift that they will make them happy. The key point here is to make them feel they are being attended to.
- **Poor customer service** can also hinder a business’s ability to **attract future customers** (Customer always talk about their experiences, **especially the bad ones**). It’s also crucial for businesses to **respond to all their queries or questions** from their customers promptly. Having **more happy customers**, improving sales, and increasing revenue. Most organizations **invest big time in customer service** because it will improve sales and also strengthen the **brand identity**.



providing excellent customer service is very important for any business.  this customer may be an internal customer as well i.e. another team.



The external customer is the person who purchases the goods or services, while the internal customer is anyone within an organization who at any time is dependent on anyone else within the organization.



To be clear, an external customer is **a person who is not directly connected to your organization other than by purchasing your product or service**.



**What are the types of external customers?**

- Potential customer – The Potential Paul.
- New customer – New Neil.
- Impulsive Customer – Impulsive Iggy.
- Discount customer – Discount Dan.
- Loyal customer – Loyal Larry.



**The four primary customer types are:**

- Price buyers. These customers want to buy products and services only at the lowest possible price. ...
- Relationship buyers. ...
- Value buyers. ...
- Poker player buyers.





training their **customer service representatives (CSRs)** to handle demanding customers without having them go through possibly costly mistakes in front of real customers.

Customer service scenarios are training tools used by businesses to educate customer service representatives on how to handle specified challenging or monotonous situations.

**Difficult customers** constantly complain, are excessively demanding, or constantly switch their complaints. It can be challenging for CSRs to deal with these customers on the phone, so many businesses use customer service scenarios to help CSRs learn how to deal with them.

Employers can create customer service scenarios to help train their CSRs or purchase them from third-party sources. The business will gain the loyalty of many potential customers if it provides outstanding customer service. By providing excellent customer service, more sales and marketing opportunities are created. Therefore, it is imperative to meet the needs of your customers to maintain your business’ success.







### Customer wanted one but gave another 

Tell me about a time a customer wanted one thing, but you felt they needed something else. How did you approach the situation, what were your actions and what was the end result?  

I always try to understand the problem fully by asking a lot of questions to the customer (in your interview it is important to note that this customer may be an internal customer as well i.e. another team). In these types of scenarios it necessary that you are very knowledgeable about your domain(product). Sample answer: One time a customer called in and asked us to reduce the bill. After my communication with him it turns out that all he wanted to do was to know where his money was going. He wanted to be "in control" of his money. After I explained the bill in detail and our pre-payment notification options, he was more than satisfied and I was also able to sell him another product at the end of our transaction.





### Went extra for a customer

Tell me about a time when you went above and beyond the call of duty for a customer. Why did you take the action you did? What was the outcome?  

Open with: "Nothing is above and beyond. My duty is to make the customer happy so in all the scenarios I take it as my personal responsibility to help him/her as much as I can." Give an example of calling a customer many times to solve the issue and to make sure that him/her was happy with the outcome.





### Felt frustrated or impatient with customers

Most of us at one time or another have felt frustrated or impatient when dealing with customers. Can you tell us about a time when you felt this way and how you dealt with it?  

Happens a lot. You need to show here that you don't loose your temper and you can manage these situations well. My response: "I ask for a pause, take a step back and analyze who/what will be affected with this and how it can be resolved. Then return back to the customer with your solution". Sample answer: One time a team that provides us the products specs changed them completely but the management(customer in this case) still wanted the product to be ready in 1 month. I took a step back made a quick analysis of the situation. Presented the management with my report backed up with numbers (numbers are always important) and ask them either to delay the product due date or pick some features to be left off. Seeing my numbers and my analysis they were cooperative in the end.



### Say no to an unreasonable customer request

When do you think it’s appropriate to push back or say no to an unreasonable customer request? Can you give me an example of when you’ve been able to see around the corner to meet a customer need or delight a customer with a solution or product they didn’t yet know they needed/wanted?  

It is important to know that to be able to understand if a request is unreasonable, you REALLY know your product and your teams well. For internal customers: use numbers to influence them. For external customers: communication is key. Same answer to "Tell me about a time a customer wanted one thing, but you felt they needed something else. How did you approach the situation, what were your actions and what was the end result?" applies here as well.



### Promise more than we can deliver (overcommitted)

To try to meet the high expectations of our customers, we sometimes promise more than we can deliver. Tell me about a time when you overcommitted yourself or your company. How did you resolve the issue?  

Sincerity is the key. Communicate that you really wanted to help but overlooked some aspects of the work. Admitting honestly that you overcommitted yourself is not a bad thing. You come up with an alternative solution to your customer "before" the deadline is reached. If you think you maybe have overcommitted, do not forget to communicate with the customer constantly and keep them updated. If your customer is "in the know" of the latest status, he/she will be more understanding.



### Balance customer needs vs. business needs

Tell me about a time when you had to balance the needs of the customer vs. the needs of the business. How did you manage this situation?  

In these types of situations, it is important to analyze if the needs of that particular customer is the need of all the customers (i.e. its impact). If so, then make necessary changes, if not, bias towards the company's needs. Saying this is important because this is not a typical answer and recruiters love these kinds of "out of the box" answers. Do not go and blindly say "I will do this and this to balance the needs of both sides"



------

## OWNERSHIP

### Did task outside your area of responsibility

Tell me about a time when you took on something significant outside your area of responsibility. Why was it important? What was the outcome?  

I realized that using outlook email significantly reduced the efficiency of the whole company (more than 3000) people. So I "lobbied" with the tech team and moved the company to Slack for internal communications and that really helped a lot with our workflows. "This may seem insignificant or not may responsibility but I take it as a personal duty to improve all aspects of my work/company."

### Not going to meet the commitments

Give me an example of a time when you didn't think you were going to meet the commitments you promised. How did you identify the risk and communicate it to stakeholders? What was the outcome?  

Number, number and numbers. Always provide numbers and analysis to your stakeholders to get their consent about everything. Constant communication is also key here. Important tip: I used to create an email list for my project and made it a habit of constantly updating the stakeholder with the latest status of the project.

### Decision to sacrifice short-term gain

Tell me about a time you made a hard decision to sacrifice short-term gain for a longer term goal.  

Completing a project would mean that I will get a very good rating this quarter but it would also mean that some features would be missing from the product. Instead of completing it this quarter I communicated that it should be completed next quarter. In the end the product was better and I got an "golden star" for my contributions to this awesome product.

### Peer struggling and helped

Give an example of when you saw a peer struggling and decided to step in and help. What was the situation and what actions did you take? What was the outcome?  

A new hire was struggling with a piece of messy code. I knew the code was heavy and I could see that he was stressed and did not quite grasp the code fully, but he did not wanted to ask for help in order to be not be seen as incompetent. I offered him my help and helped him dissected the code together. He is now one of our best coders.

### Work transitioned effectively to new owners

What steps do you take to ensure projects you complete get transitioned effectively to new owners? Give an example where you elected to re- engage on a project that you had already transitioned to someone else. What was the situation and why did you feel it was important to re‐engage?  

Important to note that you have the habit of starting the documentation from day 1. Your answer is good here: Safety Project - It was successfully delivered and I gave transition to Business Owners as it went to maintenance mode. After 3 months , I started seeing defects which were not seen before and I kind of sensed it something was missed, access was not properly configured.

### Team stays connected to the company vision

How do you ensure your team stays connected to the company vision and the bigger picture? Give an example of when you felt a team or individual goal was in conflict with the company vision. What did you do? (Manager)  

Communication is key. You need to be in touch with your team all the time. Weekly meetings and status updates ensure that the team & company are in synch. When I realize that an individual goal is in conflict, I sit down with my team member and try to solve the conflict with him. (Solving the conflict without him and telling him what to do instead would make him unhappy)

### Initiative benefit the whole company

Tell me about an initiative you undertook because you saw that it could benefit the whole company or your customers, but wasn’t within any group’s individual responsibility so nothing was being done. (Manager)  

Our team was using a lot of tools during the day and being a "measuring geek", I was wondering how I was spending my time with the tools. So I created a browser extension that will analyze my usage of the tools. That extension later used by the whole company to optimize our workload.

## INVENT AND SIMPLIFY

### Most innovative thing

Know when not to reinvent the wheel? Tell me about the most innovative thing you’ve done and why you thought it was innovative (can also probe with: That sounds more evolutionary than revolutionary – tell me about something you’ve done you feel was truly revolutionary? Ask for one or two additional examples to see if it’s a one off or pattern  

We were replying to a lot of incoming support emails. I thought that if we place the URL of online support page for that particular question at the end of our email response to that customer, we could "train" the customers to use the online support center more. (i.e. at the end of our reply, writing something like: "Did you now that you can also find the answer of this exact questions on this page on our online support center: ...") This turned out to be very successful in reducing the incoming support emails. 

### Complex problem solved with a simple solution

People often say the simplest solution is the best. Tell me about a particular complex problem you solved with a simple solution.  

The answer above fits here as well: We were replying to a lot of incoming support emails. I thought that if we place the URL of online support page for that particular question at the end of our email response to that customer, we could "train" the customers to use the online support center more. (i.e. at the end of our reply, writing something like: "Did you now that you can also find the answer of this exact questions on this page on our online support center: ...") This turned out to be very successful in reducing the incoming support emails. 

### Did something significantly simpler for customers

Tell me about a time you were able to make something significantly simpler for customers. What drove you to implement this change?  

While I was working at a bank, I implemented a solution for our customers to send another person money by a simple text message. A code is received by the other person and he/she can withdraw the money from an ATM without using a bank card. I found this solution as a way fro parents to send money for their kids in school when they need it and to became vey popular among parents and their kids in school. "Dad I ran out of money. "Here is your code, you can instantly use any ATM to withdraw 50 USD without using a bank card""

### A problem were usual approach was not going to work

Describe a challenging problem or situation in which the usual approach was not going to work. Why were you unable to take the usual approach? What alternative approach did you take? Was it successful?  

When a customer tweets about a bad service they get from us. We have a procedure for our customer support team to get in touch with that person using private messaging on Twitter and solve their problem. This one time the complaining customer was kind of an internet celebrity. Using standard customer support procedures would make him "feel like an ordinary person" so I suggested that we create another procedure for internet celebrities that included contacting them from a VP level. Internet celebrities were very happy for being contacted by a high profile employees and they even now praise us on social media due to this.

### Creative idea really difficult to implement

Give an example of a creative idea you had that proved really difficult to implement. What was the idea and what made it difficult to implement? Was it successful?  

While I was working on a multinational company, I had the idea of automating a really manual job across all regions. The task was to automate the approval of customer addresses. The task was really hard due to different formats of the addresses each country uses.  After careful planning we created a task force that included people from all different nationalities and manage to complete the project by constant communication and hard work. It reduced the manual workload of address checking by 20% globally.

### An out of the box idea that had a big impact

Tell me about an out of the box idea you had or decision you made that had a big impact on your business.  

The automation process I described above also applies to this questions.

### Changed the direction of a specific function/department

Give me an example of how you have changed the direction or view of a specific function/department and helped them embrace a new way of thinking? Why was a change needed?  

6-7 years ago, when social media was relatively new, Customer Service Department's didn't know much about social media monitoring or SM customer support. As the head of marketing, I worked with them and helped them to embrace the new "social" way of customer support. (Which is a huge thing now)



## ARE RIGHT, A LOT

### Rely on your judgment and instincts

Tell me about a decision for which data and analysis weren’t sufficient to provide the right course and you had to rely on your judgment and instincts. Give me two to three examples. They don’t have to be big strategic decisions – could be big or small. 

 1. Thought that social media will be big for customer support although it was fairly new. 2. Mobile commerce would be big so my team revamped our mobile app before any competition during 2011.

### Difficult decision but a right solution

Tell me about a time you made a difficult decision and how you knew it was the right solution (probe on how they evaluated the options, if they received input, what data they reviewed, etc.)  

Shifting all newspaper advertising budget to online advertising. I knew that measurable advertising mediums is the future so I decided to move all the print advertising budget to online advertising in my previous company. Faced a lot of drawback while doing this but in the end number showed that it was a right decision.

### Important decision without input

Give me an example of when you have to make an important decision in the absence of good data because there just wasn’t any. What was the situation and how did you arrive at your decision? Did the decision turn out to be the correct one? Why or why not?  

Spending a budget of X to integrate social media customer support to our regular CSR systems. Although there wasn't enough data to justify it, the trends showed that providing support from social media would be big. As a result, my last company was handling 25% of the customer support from social media when I was leaving the company.

### Bad decision experience learned

Tell me about a time when you made a bad decision and the learning from the experience enabled you to make a good decision later. What did you learn that you were able to apply?  

In the early days of my product management career, during the launch planning stage of a product I was responsible of, I incorrectly assumed that the design deliverables would be ready in two months without asking the UX/UI Team responsible from that task. I based this "two months" assumption on the fact that similar tasks were delivered about 30-45 days from that Team before. Little I was aware of, there was a restructuring going on within that group and they wouldn't be able to deliver the design tasks before two month. I worked with that Team very closely to have the items delivered in 70 days (slight delay) but this was a stressful period both for me and the UI Team. From that they I never "assumed" a delivery time and always checked with the appropriate teams first.

### A challenge, decide the best way forward

Tell me about a time when you have been faced with a challenge where the best way forward or strategy to adopt was not “clear cut” (i.e. there were a number of possible solutions). How did you decide the best way forward?  

Monitoring Social Media for your product/company is now ubiquitous. Back in the day when this process was new to everybody, I proposed that we watch social media for comments and feedbacks about this product we were launching. We had a problem though: No one knew what to do with the feedback received and how to reply to customer comments on social media. There were many strategies to adopt and all had a certain amount of risk associated with them. In the end we choose the "the path that puts the customer first no matter what", i.e. reply to them on social media immediately and try your best to make them happy (and thus turn them into product advocates). This proved to be the best mid-term strategy to adopt boosting our" love mark" scores. 

### Error in judgment you made and impact

Tell me about an error in judgment you made in the last year or two, what it was and the impact of it  

As a Team Lead, I was assigning tasks to my Team for a mobile testing project and I assigned an eager junior functional tester to a UX testing job. Normally I would not do that but the guy seemed so eager and promised he'll deliver a stellar testing performance. In the end his output was mediocre and it wasn't something our team normally delivers. This thought me to always distribute the jobs according to expertise. If someone is eager but not qualified to do a task, have him trained first to make him qualified for that task and then assign him to the task he wants..

## HIRE AND DEVELOP THE BEST

### Best hires of your career

Give me an example of one of the best hires of your career. How did this person progress through their career? What did you identify during the hiring process that drove his or her success?  

One time I was stuck between two candidates to hire for an important ass. Manager position. One had a college degree from an Ivy League school and the other barely made it through the college. I liked the humbleness, openness and humility of the second candidate. He sincerely looked like a hard worker whereas the pother candidate (still a good prospect) did kind of seemed entitled. In the end I ended up hiring the barely-out-of-college student and he became the top performer among his colleagues. So I now always look for personality traits as much, if not more, than education credentials when doing a hiring.

### Help team members develop their careers

Tell me how you help your team members develop their careers. Can you give me two to three examples of specific people in whom invested and how you helped them develop their careers including one who wasn’t being successful but you saw potential and chose to invest?  

Communication is key. My secret here is during my first meeting, I always ask this question to my reportees: "What motivates you?" Trying the understand the driving force of people and keeping the communication lines open always works. In my last company I came across a reportee of mine who seemed stubborn and his performance has dropped in the last two months. Other managers did not know what to do before me and were thinking of letting him go. With my "constant & open communication" approach, I actually learned from him that he was really unhappy because he though he would be promoted into my spot instead of an external hire (me). I communicated to him that other managers were thinking he was lacking a few aspects for team management and promised to work with him very closely to improve his skillset. After 2 years, I was promoted to lead another team and this guy told me that he was very lucky to be working with me and he improved in ways he would not imagine. And of course he was promoted to my spot after I left.

### Provided feedback to develop the strengths of someone

Give me an example of a time you have provided feedback to develop and leverage the strengths of someone on your team. Were you able to positively impact that person’s performance? What were your most effective methods?  

I think the key to positively impact someone's performance is to give positive feedback about the things he is happy to hear about. How to find out the things him/her likes to hear: well, that is something you observe during your 1-1's. Once I had this reportee of mine who was managing relationships with the external agencies, I figured out that once you give feedback about "how this or that agency thinks that you are a great communicator" this made her very happy. I used this feedback technique to improve her communication skills even further and in the end she also took the role of "internal comms manager"  in addition to her daily job. She was thrilled to be doing that.

## INSIST ON THE HIGHEST STANDARDS

### Unsatisfied with the status quo

Tell me about a time when you have been unsatisfied with the status quo. What did you do to change it? Were you successful?  

You can say that I am obsessed with efficiency. In my last company, we used to have too many meetings and at some stage it felt like we were going to the office to have meetings instead of doing real jobs. Starting with my team, I limited the meetings to 2 half an hour meetings per week. It is amazing to see how efficient the meetings become once you have limited time to discuss all the topics. Instead of typical laid back 1 hour x 5 meetings every week, we were getting the same benefits from the meetings in just 1 hour per week. Of course it did not stop there and I nagged all the managers I can find and by explaining the benefits we had, made them adopt this system as well. 

### Wouldn’t compromise on achieving a great outcome

Tell me about a time you wouldn’t compromise on achieving a great outcome when others felt something was good enough. What was the situation? What measures have you personally put in place to ensure performance improvement targets and standards are achieved?  

In my prev. Company, we had a rule that says "If you are creating a n page for the website, the total time it takes for the web page to be rendered in a browser window should be less than 1.5 seconds." For one of our projects this number appeared to be 1.55 seconds and the other managers were OK with that. But I know that this wouldn't cut. Web technologies are evolving and Google says many users will be leaving your website if it does not open near-instantly (That's why they are pushing big with AMP and PWA). I consulted with the tech lead and figured out that some optimizations could be done to improve the javascript performance and pressed that this should be done in favor of our users. In the end I was able to convince other managers a swell and as a result of the changes the render time was dropped to 1.42 seconds.

### Most significant, continuous improvement project

Describe the most significant, continuous improvement project that you have led. What was the catalyst to this change and how did you go about it?  

I used to work at a multi national online advertising company with offices in many countries. My team was one of the biggest teams and part of our job was to check incoming applications from users to sign up to our advertising program to include their website in our ad network. That check included a name check, address format check and website check for that particular user. And if we find anything that seems problematic, we would reject the application and sent it back to the customer to fill the information again. This task was taking about 20% of our daily activity. After my 3 months in the company I suggested that we automate those checks as much as we can to save manpower. I became the lead of the project and started managing tech teams, localization teams and different contributing teams from different countries. After an effort of 8 months, we were able to automate 80% of those checks (so, e.g. a tool automatically checks if the address is right for that particular country). The project was a huge success for the company and I was awarded a Platinum Star for that project.

### A goal you’ve had where you wish you had done better

Give me an example of a goal you’ve had where you wish you had done better. What was the goal and how could you have improved on it? 

 I think that the key to achieve any goal is to plan early and to plan in detail. At the start of my career I was given some tasks to be completed at a set date but the end result was less optimum than I expected and it was delivered late. From that time on, I started to plan every project early and in detail, counting all the factors as much as possible.

### Worked to improve the quality of a product that was already good

Tell me about a time when you have worked to improve the quality of a product / service / solution that was already getting good customer feedback? Why did you think it needed continued improvement?  

There is always room for improvement! I used to work at an online marketplace and the sale numbers were quite good. The thing with online websites and mobil websites is, the technology is constantly evolving and new solutions for faster products appear constantly. So our mobile website was pretty decent and did have good loading times, and the customers were loving it. But I started a project to convert it to Google AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) and Google PWA (Progressive Web Apps). This enabled our mobile website to be future proof, enabling us to concentrate on other tasks to grow the business.

### Refused to compromise your standards

Give an example where you refused to compromise your standards around quality/customer service, etc. Why did you feel so strongly about the situation? What were the consequences? The result?  

For one of our products, the headcount number for support operations was 5 people and I got word from my superiors that they wanted to increase the "promised" customer response time from 1 hours  to 2 hours in order to reduce workload. I was really against this and knew that customer support is one of the most important things, if not the most, for your business to be successful. I researched research papers and number to justify my claim that if anything, we should be increasing our headcount for support. I gave examples from industry leaders and convinced them to not to change the headcount. Fast forward 1 year, the company was strongly considering to decrease the response time to 30 minutes across board, since my product was the one with the best customer happiness score and the most revenue.

## THINK BIG

### Radical approach to a problem

Give me an example of a radical approach to a problem you proposed. What was the problem and why did you feel it required a completely different way of thinking about it? Was your approach successful?  

(Similar answer to a question above but with other details). I used to work at a multi national online advertising company with offices in many countries. My team was one of the biggest teams and part of our job was to check incoming applications from users to sign up to our advertising program to include their website in our ad network. That check included an address format check and website check for that particular user. And if we find anything that seems problematic, we would reject the application and sent it back to the customer to fill the information again. These tasks were taking about 20% of our daily activity. After my 3 months in the company I suggested that we automate those checks as much as we can to save manpower. This was a radical solution because everyone thought that with the complexity involved (just imagine all the different address formats associated with all the different countries / cities) this was an impossible task to accomplish. I became the lead of the project and started managing tech teams, localization teams and different contributing teams from different countries to identify the address formats and stat building the automation software with that data. After an effort of 8 months, we were able to automate 80% of those checks (so, e.g. a tool automatically checks if the address is right for that particular country). The project was a huge success for the company and I was awarded a Platinum Star for that project.

### Drive adoption for your vision/ideas

How do you drive adoption for your vision/ideas? How do you know how well your idea or vision has been adopted by other teams or partners?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Communication and the persuasive power of the numbers. Having good communication lines open goes a long way in persuading people for your project. Having numbers backing up your idea is the sure-fire way of getting people on your side.

### Saw something bigger than the initial focus

Tell me about time you were working on an initiative or goal and saw an opportunity to do something much bigger than the initial focus.  

I used to work in a company as the person responsible for online advertising. The initial task given to me was to analyze and improve the ad spending budget. After careful analysis and number crunching, I convinced the upper management to shift focus of advertising spending to online for some of our products because online ads were clearly performing better than traditional ads. So what started as a "relatively" simple online ad spend analysis turned into a fully fledged re-organization of our advertising spend. I was able to achieve this by working above and beyond my line of duty: instead of just looking a to online ad spend numbers, I was curious and looked at other ad budgets & returns as well, thus prompting a larger scope of work for me.

### Questioned a working process

Tell me about a time you looked at a key process that was working well and questioned whether it was still the right one? What assumptions were you questioning and why? Did you end up making a change to the process? 

 I always look at even very simple tasks and question if they are efficient or not. A simple example of this would be my approach to project management tools. In my previous company, I have realized that my Team was using a pre-formatted excel sheet to keep track of their projects, and their statuses. Although they were very efficient with using Excel, there were newer tools that allows you to collaborate more effectively. I persuaded them to switch to that tool after a while. Although there were some concerns at the beginning, now people swear by it and never look back. (This sample answer also shows that you try to improve even the small things in your work environment as well.)

### Took a big risk and worked

Tell me about a time you took a big risk – what was the risk, how did you decide to do it and what was the outcome?  

We were planning the features to put in our soon-to-be updated website for this financial company( i.e. bank) that I was working. I was the head of project and to the amaze of my other colleagues, I said that I would make the frontpage a big search box only. So, there would be no content on the front page but only a search box. This was obviously not seen before, but I thought that our frontpage should be a gateway to our services. I wanted the users to leave the homepage as quickly as possible to their searched product/service (much like google.com) This idea was discussed a lot and in the end the company implemented it. It was a huge success and feedback started to pour in about how simple & fast our website is. Our users liked it a lot and our competitors soon followed suit.

### Took a big risk and it failed

Now Tell me about a time you took a big risk and it failed. What did you learn? What would you do differently?  

As a product manager, I decided to use only  advertising for the launch of one of our products. Upon management's permission for my "trial" we shifted all our budget to online. After the launch the numbers weren't bad but it was behind similar launches who used online/offline advertising simultaneously. That gave me a lesson to follow the rule of numbers and learn from past (launch) experiences.

## BIAS FOR ACTION

### Calculated risk that you have taken

Give me an example of a calculated risk that you have taken where speed was critical. What was the situation and how did you handle it? What steps did you take to mitigate the risk? What was the outcome?  

(Similar answer as the question below. Here, you'll need to show that you are action oriented, but only if you have enough data to back up your action). One time we were about to launch a product live and just got a "you need to stop this" alert from the tech team saying that they have found a bug. It was just minutes left for the project to go live and I could not get a handle of my manager (no phone reception). I quickly sat down with the tech managers and tried to understand the bug and it's possible effects. It was an important bug that needed to be fixed. Due to my technical background, I knew that this would be a problem when we have more than 10.000 concurrent users on the system which was not expected at least in the first 10 days. The Tech Team assured me that they can fix it in 3 days so I went ahead and gave the project a go. After the project is live, the Tech Team implemented a fix in 2 days so everything turned out to be fine in the end. Should I went ahead and halted the project it would be a much bigger problem for the company.

### Made an important business decision without consulting manager

Describe a situation where you made an important business decision without consulting your manager. What was the situation and how did it turn out?  

(You need to show that you are not afraid of taking actions if you are confident with your decision). One time we were about to launch a product live and just got a "you need to stop this" alert from the tech team saying that they have found a bug. It was just minutes left for the project to go live and I could not get a handle of my manager (no phone reception). I quickly sat down with the tech managers and tried to understand the bug and it's possible effects. It was an important bug that needed to be fixed. Due to my technical background, I knew that this would be a problem when we have more than 10.000 concurrent users on the system which was not expected at least in the first 10 days. The Tech Team assured me that they can fix it in 3 days so I went ahead and gave the project a go. After the project is live, the Tech Team implemented a fix in 2 days so everything turned out to be fine in the end. Should I went ahead and halted the project it would be a much bigger problem for the company.

### Analyze facts quickly, define key issues, and respond immediately

Tell me about a time when you had to analyze facts quickly, define key issues, and respond immediately to a situation. What was the outcome?  

You can use the similar answer as the 2 questions above. Just paraphrase it to fit in this situation.

### Worked against tight deadlines

Tell me about a time when you have worked against tight deadlines and didn't have the time to consider all options before making a decision. How much time did you have? What approach did you take?  

Here, you'll need to show that, if you do not have access to all options, make sure that the options you have will give you a significant indication. The approach should be: "I knew that I did not analyzed all the options, but I knew that the options I have were enough to give me a good confidence level on my decision. Numbers never lie."

### Move forward or gathering more information

Give an example of when you had to make an important decision and had to decide between moving forward or gathering more information. What did you do? What information is necessary for you to have before acting?  

Similar to the reply above, but this time you have to tell them, "based on the numbers and analysis I have, I knew that the options we have did not give us enough confidence levels to make an informed decision". You can use the reply to the questions above as a basis for answering this one as well.

### Felt your team was not acting quickly

Tell me about a time where you felt your team was not moving to action quickly enough. What did you do? (Manager)  

Always try to understand the reason behind this by communication. Never say something like "I tried to motivate them by giving incentives" as your initial approach. You can give incentives or use other methods, but Amazon likes to hear that you tired to communicate with your team to understand the root cause of the problem.

### Remove a roadblock preventing your team from making progress

Tell me about a time when you were able to remove a serious roadblock/barrier preventing your team from making progress? How were you able to remove the barrier? What was the outcome? (Manager)  

My team was working with different branches of the tech team on a project and the way things are setup, they use a "liaison" for every branch. The project was time sensitive and going through this extra layer of communication was clearly making things slower. For this project, I proposed that we skip the liaison officers and communicate directly with the tech people. Management was reluctant but I showed them this change will be for the better by communication with only one branch without a liaison. After they saw that things were moving much faster with that tech branch & us, they allowed us to work with no liaison officers for all the branches within the tech team in our project.



------

## BEING FRUGAL (FRUGALITY)

### Save costs or eliminate waste

Give me an example of how you have helped save costs or eliminate waste within your operation.  

My motto here is: "If there is a more efficient way of doing things, it almost always shows itself." This answer could be something like the answer above (saving headcount by not utilizing liaisons for communicating with the tech team). 

### Make tradeoffs between quality and cost

Tell me about a time when you had to make tradeoffs between quality and cost. How did you weigh the options? What was the result?  

In my previous company, we were building a website for our project that sells skin supplies for men & women. We had two options, either use a standard cms provider (shopify or wordpress) or build our own custom design from scratch. Building from scratch meant that the website will obviously look much better but it would cost 3 months to develop (thus more costly). Going with Shopify meant that the design would not be as perfect but it will be much less costly and we would be able to start selling earlier. We decided to start with Shopify and actually realized that we were putting too much emphasis on design, which wasn't necessary. We were able to customize the look and feel of our Shopify store and it matched 80% of our expectations, design-wise. In the end we did not changed the design to a custom one at all. Shopify was sufficient for us..

### Project needed half of the resources

Tell me about a time you had to get something done with half or two thirds of the resources you thought you’d need for the project or initiative.  

In my opinion, properly motivated people will be nearly 2 times as efficient as a regular person. (By motivation I do not necessarily mean an incentive, it could very well be a "happy" team). To answer this questions, always mention that you are used to working in similar environments, where you finish your project "startup style" with little or no resources. Then talk about a project where you were able to motivate the team to perform in a much more efficient manner for that project.

### Creative solution to a problem without additional resources

Tell me about a time when you generated a creative solution to a problem or project without requiring additional resources. What was the problem? What was the solution and how did you come up with it?  

In my previous company, one of my team's responsibilities was to answer incoming support emails. There were thousands of emails in the queue and we were struggling to catch up with them. The problem was we had a pretty good online help center but people was not using it, sending us questions that would be easily found in the help center FAQ. I came up with a project to "educate" the customers by sending them the help center links in the reply emails in addition to our answers. The rate of incoming mails dropped around 20% in two months.

Didn’t have enough resources but found a way to get it done

Tell me about a time you didn’t have enough resources to do something you felt was important but found a creative way to get it done anyway. What drove you to seek out creative solutions?  

Similar to the answer to the questions above: We needed a tool to analyze the incoming support mails and send an auto reply with the matching online help center information. Our tech team reported that they do not have enough resources for this so I had to be creative and stated to insert the online help center links manually to our outgoing replies. The rate of incoming mails dropped around 20% in two months.

### Requested additional funding/budget to complete a project

Give an example of a time you requested additional funding/budget to complete a project. Why was it needed? Did you try to figure out another approach? Did you get the additional resources? Why or why not?  

The key point here is that you need to backup your requests with detailed analysis and you need to show the recruiter that your efforts to increase the budget was finally successful. For example: "For a product launch, I asked the management to increase the UX/UI design budget. It was denied initially but after the post-launch analysis, they saw that the extra budget would have been useful  and they were OK with increasing the budget for the future projects."



------

## EARN TRUST

### Improving morale and productivity on team

Describe a time when you significantly contributed to improving morale and productivity on your team. What were the underlying problems and their causes? How did you prevent them from negatively impacting the team in the future?  

In my previous company we were about to launch a product and there was a big pressure on our Team of 5 people. Just two weeks before the launch date, one of team members had to leave for family emergency and another one broke his arms in an accident. The Team was really demoralized and thought that we were never able to make it for the launch deadline. It was up to me to keep the morale high and make the team deliver on time. What I did is, I announced that the upcoming 2 weeks is the "happy & fun product launch extravaganza and sort of made it a team building activity. I also asked for extra hands from a few teams that we were working close on this project and as a result we were able to finish the product on time. Now my Team thinks that anything is possible if you approach it with a "go-getter" attitude..

### Not able to meet a commitment to a team member

Give an example of a time where you were not able to meet a commitment to a team member. What was the commitment and what prevented you from meeting it? What was the outcome and what did you learn from it?  

During the early stages of my career, I over-promised to a teammate to finish a task for him in two weeks. I already had more than I could handle but I thought I need to push hard to impress with my performance in the company. It was a misjudgment on my side and I failed to deliver the task on time. It did not reflect good on my review but thought me an important lesson: Know your limits and do not exaggerate what you can do. Learning to say no is important and it is better to say no to a task than not being able to deliver it.

### built trusting working relationships with others

Tell me about how you have effectively built trusting working relationships with others on your team.  

Communication and "I always got your back" attitude is key. You also need to lead by example. When your team mates see that you are a hard working person, a respectful relationship starts to build.

### Cooperation of a peer who were resistant to what you do

Describe a time when you needed the cooperation of a peer or peers who were resistant to what you were trying to do. What did you do? What was the outcome?  

When I see some resistance from my team mates, instead of being defensive, I always try to understand the underlying reasons of their attitude. We should not let this difference of opinion divide us for our current and future projects. ( Here, you must show to the recruiter that you communicated with those people to find out the reason behind their resistance ad solved it.) For example: In my previous company, we had a corporate website, and I thought that we must revamped to reflect the current design standards and technologies. My team mates were really resistant to the idea. After talking with them it turned out that they also think the website should be updated, but they thought this project will make them work extra long hours to be completed. I persuaded them by finding a common ground between project completion time and necessary overtime. 

### Direct feedback gave to a colleague

Tell me about a piece of direct feedback you recently gave to a colleague. How did he or she respond? How do you like to receive feedback from coworkers or managers?  

There is a misconception about feedback that it almost always is negative. Here, you can surprise your recruiter by directly telling a positive feedback you gave to your team mates. For example: I had a colleague that used to work in a very organized fashion. I gave her direct feedback about how I find this habit a very useful one, and I told her she should be sharing her practices with the rest of the team. She was not expecting this and it contributed to her performing above expectations that quarter.

### Communicate change in direction which people have concerns

Tell me about a time you had to communicate a big change in direction for which you anticipated people would have a lot of concerns. How did you handle questions and/or resistance? Were you able to get people comfortable with the change?  

In my previous company, the management decided to change the bonus structure and decided to tie to the individuals quarterly rating instead of the teams performance factor. In these types of changes, first of all you need to understand all the details and its effects in detail before facing your team to announce the news. Here it is also important to know that sometimes you  can not make everybody happy and that is OK.



------

## DIVE DEEP

### Trying to understand a problem and dig deep

Tell me about a time you were trying to understand a problem on your team and you had to go down several layers to figure it out. Who did you talk with and what information proved most valuable? How did you use that information to help solve the problem? 

 (Tip: You need to show that you are persistent with your research. ) In my company I am know to go the extra mile to fix things that I put my mind to. Sometimes your team mates will be reluctant to tell you the real story because they will think it can be embarrassing, but with open communication you will be able to get the details.

### Problem solved that required in‐depth thought and analysis

Tell me about a problem you had to solve that required in‐depth thought and analysis? How did you know you were focusing on the right things?  

Example: In my previous company, we had an online service that we sell to our customers. No matter what the age group 30-45 did not adopt the product as much as we would like them to be. After a through analysis based on many things (online spending habit of that demographics, shopping funnel and dropout pages in the website, cross-checking of their usage behaviors on our other products) we were able to identify the culprit and by amending it we were able to increase sales for that demographic.

### Linked two or more problems together and identified the issue

Tell me about a time when you linked two or more problems together and identified an underlying issue? Were you able to find a solution?  

You can use the "online help center education" answer used in one of the answers above. For example: Problem was that there was a big backlog in incoming support center emails and we were not able to answer questions on time. Also, we figured out that our customers just sent us an email when they had a small issue without even looking at the online help center. In order to solve these two problems we started a program to "educate" our users about the online help center and we made the "send us an email" link harder to find. In turn, customers started to spend more time in the online help center pages and number of incoming emails reduced significantly.

### A big problem in your organization you solved

Walk me through a big problem or issue in your organization that you helped to solve. How did you become aware of it? What information did you gather, what information was missing and how did you fill the gaps? Did you do a post mortem analysis and if you did what did you learn?  

Back in my last company which was a financial institution, there was an issue with feedbacks about strange account balance abnormalities. Some customers were saying that their balances were off by a cent or so. This of course was a big issue and the company couldn't figure out what the problem was. I was a new employee working on operations but I volunteered and  worked with the tech team and after careful analysis, we have found out that the error was happening due to our (older) systems rounding the numbers to 2 significant digits after the zero. We have changed it to be 4 significant digits and solved the problem. This was actually a huge problem for the company and if it were to continue for a while, the company would have major backlash in the media.

### Specific metric you have used to identify a need for a change

Can you tell me about a specific metric you have used to identify a need for a change in your department? Did you create the metric or was it already available? How did this and other information influence the change?  

In my previous company we were working with many internal tools (software apps) and I was thinking that we were spending more time in tool X than we should have. I am not a coder nornally, but I learned to create a Firefox browser extension and I coded a small extension for myself to analyze which tools I am using most. Based on my findinds, I went to my manager and told him that we should bespending less time in tool X and rather spend more time in tool Y. The manager was very interested and after trying my browser extension on all of my team mates computers, it was clear that we were allocating our time inefficiently and changed our way of working with our tools.



------

## DELIVER RESULTS

### Realized not the right goal when we were more than half way

Tell me about a time you (and your team if Manager) were driving toward a goal and were more than half way to the objective when you realized it may not be the best or right goal or may have unintended consequences. What was the situation and what did you do?   

For a vendors project, the testing was not  going the way its intended to go. It used to be the waterfall model but we changed the methodology to sprint in middle. It enabled us to finish the project on time. (Here the important thing is you need to show that you are a person that constantly checks the status of the project & and you are able to see the problems ahead.) 

### A goal took a long time to achieve

Tell me about a goal that you set that took a long time to achieve or that you are still working towards. How do you keep focused on the goal given the other priorities you have?  

A typical example for this will be a business transformation tasks. They always take long so the correct approach to this question is "you need to divide the tasks into small pieces with deadlines so it would seem like many micro-projects." This strategy keeps the motivations up.

### A goal you exceeded expectations

Tell me about a time where you not only met a goal but considerably exceeded expectations. How were you able to do it? What challenges did you have to overcome?  

The trick for this question is "Due to my previous experience, I suggested a new approach to a problem we were having in my new company. This new approach both enabled us to save time and budget on the project. This was not expected of me and I was highly praised with my solution and management of the process"

### Deliver an important project under a tight deadline

Give me an example of a time when you were able to deliver an important project under a tight deadline. What sacrifices did you have to make to meet the deadline? How did they impact the final deliverables?  

Example: "We landed on a project that was not originally part of program deliverable and came as a sudden request from a vendor.  It needed to be delivered in 3 weeks. My role was to make sure the  testing is not compromised due to shorter timeline and making sure that we were able to complete on time. We sacrificed - worked in weekends and started the performance testing early. In the end we were able to successfully compete testing on time.

### Unanticipated obstacles to overcome in achieving a goal

Tell me about a time you had significant, unanticipated obstacles to overcome in achieving a key goal. Were you eventually successful?  

In my previous company we were about to launch a product and there was a big pressure on our Team of 5 people. Just two weeks before the launch date, one of team members had to leave for family emergency and another one broke his arms in an accident. The Team was really demoralized and thought that we were never able to make it for the launch deadline. It was up to me to keep the morale high and make the team deliver on time. What I did is, I announced that the upcoming 2 weeks is the "happy & fun product launch extravaganza and sort of made it a team building activity. I also asked for extra hands from a few teams that we were working close on this project and as a result we were able to finish the product on time. Now my Team thinks that anything is possible if you approach it with a "go-getter" attitude..



------

## HAVE BACKBONE: DISAGREE AND COMMIT

### Strongly disagreed with your manager

Tell me about a time that you strongly disagreed with your manager on something you deemed to be very important to the business. What was it about and how did you handle it?  

The answer that seems to get the most positive response from the recruiters is that: When you have a disagreement with your manager, you'll need to persuade him to test your idea in smaller doses. Managers who resists ideas or changes will almost always agree to a small test to see if your idea is correct. Give an example about a scenario where you persuaded your manager to do a small test initially, and then he/she supported your idea after he saw the results.

### Took an unpopular stance in a meeting with peers

Give me an example of when you took an unpopular stance in a meeting with peers and your leader and you were the outlier. What was it, why did you feel strongly about it, and what did you do?  

For one of our product launches, we were deciding how big the support center team will be. The management and other team members said that an SLA of "answering each query in max 1 hour" was enough, but I said customers are everything for us so we should make the SLA around 30 minutes, meaning we would have to double the support team. Due to budget constraints I was not able to persuade them at that time. After 6 months, due to customer complaints, we had to double the support team as I requested back then...

### Go along with the group decision even if you disagree

When do you decide to go along with the group decision even if you disagree? Give me an example of a time you chose to acquiesce to the group even when you disagreed. Would you make the same decision now?  

The trick here is similar to some other answers below: You had to follow the decision due to budget/time/headcount limitations, but showed the management (using analysis & numbers) that the company should think ahead and prioritize this from going on.

### You felt strongly about something but lost the argument

Describe a time where you felt really strongly about something but ultimately lost the argument. How hard did you press the issue? What was your approach after you lost the argument?  

The key point here is to let the recruiters know that you are a "numbers" person. You based your decision on numbers and analysis, but lost the argument due to "intuition" of your managers. After this you have two options, depending on the question, you can continue with "but the manager's decision was right and it was a big learning for me" or "later on we saw that, if implemented, my solution would be better. This changed the perception of my manager on how do they look at my decisions. It was a big win for me."

### Business gained something because you persisted

Tell me about a time the business gained something because you persisted for a length of time. Why were you so determined? How did it turn out?  

Again here you need to show that you persisted either: 1. You have solid data and analysis to back your claim up or 2. You have a vast or specific experience about the issue in hand.

### Make a difficult decision under pressure

Provide an example of a time when you have had to make a difficult decision under pressure and then defend and justify it. Was it the right decision?  

Same answer as the above question. The recruiter is not specifically interested in about the case, but he rather wants to see your persistence and if you are relying on a solid set of data.



## LEARN & BE CURIOUS

### An idea you had that was strongly opposed

Give me an example of an idea you had that was strongly opposed. Why was there so much resistance? How did you handle the negative feedback?  

Common examples here include "management were skeptical of new ways of doing things". So based on your experience or your extensive analysis, you have found/suggested a new approach but it was rejected. Another important point here is about rejection: Always say something in the lines of "I accepted rejection gracefully but I was able to have them accept my idea after a while with help of my improved analysis/data." 

### An example of a significant professional failure

Give me an example of a significant professional failure. What did you learn from this situation?  

Example:  There was an instance in 2012  where  our team failed to sell a project to a potential client. I was Test Lead at that time and I was very closely working with my account manager to secure the sale. It should have been ours, but we dropped the ball.  I think the biggest issue was that the whole team took it for granted that the project would be ours. We had a good relationship with the client and we had just wrapped up a very successful project for them.  A team of us, led by the account manager, went to pitch. It was a solid pitch and we got great feedback. At the same time, we failed to truly understand all of the client’s key concerns. They told us that price was the #1 consideration, so we focused on demonstrating cost-effectiveness. But while reducing the cost, our offer lacked some important quality assurances and in the end we lost the sale. It is a good example that thought me not think from a single dimension but consider other aspects as well for any work I'm delivering.

### Someone openly challenged you

Tell me about a time where someone has openly challenged you. How did you handle this feedback?  

In my previous company I promoted "Mark" and "Gary" was upset about it. Gary thought that he deserved the promotion instead of Mark and was openly criticising me that I made the wrong call and I was not really fair. Instead of being angry with him, I sat down with him and shoed my notes and performance ratings of both of them to Gary. He clearly was missing some skills to be promoted and he accepted fact. I told him that he has a lot of potential and motivated him to improve so in the end he left our meeting happy.

### Made a significant mistake

Tell me about a time you made a significant mistake. What led you to making the wrong decision? What would you have done differently in retrospect?  

As a Team Lead, I was assigning tasks to my Team for a mobile testing project and I assigned an eager junior functional tester to a UX testing job. Normally I would not do that but the guy seemed so eager and promised he'll deliver a stellar testing performance. In the end his output was mediocre and it wasn't something our team normally delivers. This thought me to always distribute the jobs according to expertise no matter how eager a promising team mate is. If someone is eager but not qualified to do a task, have him trained first to make him qualified for that task and then assign him to the task he wants..

### Critical piece of feedback you received

Give an example of a tough or critical piece of feedback you received. What was it and what did you do about it?  

The trick here is to let the recruiter know that: You take the feedback with a positive attitude, break it down to see the reasons behind this feedback and approach to improve upon those small pieces.

### Received feedback which you didn’t agree

Tell me about a time you received feedback with which you didn’t agree. How did you react?  

Use this wording: "I am a person who is pretty open for constructive feedback. The ones I do not agree are basically data related ones. If I have a pretty detailed analysis based on numbers and someone criticizes it, I do openly not agree with it. Most of the times, if that person is open to it, I try to to sit down with the person who gave that feedback and run the numbers together."

### Learn something outside your comfort zone 

Tell me about time you had to learn something outside your comfort zone in order to drive results for your organization or to adapt to a change in the market, organization or other catalyst.  

A good example for this question will be something like this: During the early stages of my career, you would say I was a typical new grad. I was used to  do what I was assigned and did not really look into ways to improve myself on anything else. One thing I was not comfortable with was constantly following up with others teams and ask them if they completed a task I was waiting for. Doing this constant "nagging" really made me feel uncomfortable. Once I started to communicate more openly with other teams (be their friends) this embarrassing feeling of "nagging" people switched to a feeling of friends asking friends information about a project. Thus my best lesson in my professional life: Communication is key to solving nearly all types of problems!

What was the outcome? | We can tell the answer for the question "Customer wanted one thing, but you felt he needed something else"   Many of the customers were asking for vulnerability scanning requirement. We started with the implementation and promised a few of our customers that we will deliver 10 vulnerabilities. But after reaching a mid way we came to know that there is alot of work invilved as it was totally new work for us. Without much delay we did re-planning and decided to release it phase wise manner.
