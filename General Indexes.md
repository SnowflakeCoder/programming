**Lean startup**

Lean startup is a <u>methodology for developing businesses and products</u> that aims to **shorten product development cycles** and rapidly discover if a **proposed business model is viable**. Using lean startup methodology, startup companies invest their time into **iteratively building products or services to meet the needs of early customers**.  The lean startup method advocates **developing products that consumers have already demonstrated they desire** so that a market will already exist as soon as the product is launched. As **opposed to developing a product and then hoping that demand will emerge**. By employing lean startup principles, product developers can gauge consumer interest in the product and determine **how the product might need to be refined** and **get a desired product to customers' hands faster**. This process is called **validated learning**. Through lean startup, if an idea is likely to fail, it will **fail quickly and cheaply** instead of slowly and expensively, hence the term “**fail-fast**”. 

Lean startup is an example of **consumers dictating the type of products** they are offered by their respective markets, rather than those **markets dictating what products** will be offered to them. The lean startup method **first identifies a problem** that needs to be solved. It then develops a minimum viable product or the smallest form of the product that allows entrepreneurs to introduce it to potential customers for feedback. This method is **faster and less expensive**.

**MVP**

A **minimum viable product (MVP)** is a concept from **Lean Startup** (by Eric Ries) that stresses the impact of learning in new product development. A minimum viable product (MVP) is a development technique in which a new product or website is **developed with sufficient features** to satisfy early adopters. The final, complete set of features is only designed and developed **after considering feedback** from the product's initial users. The primary benefit of an MVP is you can gain <u>understanding about your customers’ interest in your product</u> **without fully developing the product**. The sooner you can find out whether your product will appeal to customers, the **less effort and expense you spend** on a product that will not succeed in the market, which helps them avoid working on a product that no one wants. MVP is a core piece of **strategy of experimentation**.
