Your employer has **commissioned the following services for you** and we begin with the top priority:

Assistance to Receive Your Visa/Work Permit In Germany

- We <u>monitor the entire administrative process</u> on our side for you to become **legally employed**.
- It is our first priority to get your **work permit organized**.

## FIRST STEP

To start the process kindly **send us the following documents** at your earliest convenience (PDF scans if possible):

Please note our privacy policy (information on data protection) and sign the consent to the use of your data (see form in appendix) and send it back.

- A copy of your passport (personal data page)
- (if applicable): Copies of family members passports, marriage certificate, birth certificate(s) that will relocate with you.
- (if applicable): any current visa or residence permit that you hold and that is valid for Germany / another EU country.
- Your work contract or job offer (with the German employer), signed
- Your diploma(s): originals and certified / notarized translations into English or German. If your original diploma is issued in English, it does not need to be translated into German. If the translation will take longer time, please send us the original diploma nonetheless first.
- Your CV (in English or German)
- Relocation Questionnaire (attached)



With these documents from you, we can **assess your work permit eligibility / type of your work permit** or have it assessed by the German employment agency. If needed we will send you **a file supporting the assessment**, which we will ask you to take with you when submitting your visa application (see next steps):

## SECOND STEP

Please read also the following steps and pay attention to the underlined section in the second step. Please contact the German embassy in the country of your residence:

1.       Please contact the German embassy in the country of your residency to learn about the necessary paperwork for your visa application. Usually you find a description of needed documents on the embassy´s website at the section: visa information / national visas. You are applying for a visa for work purpose. Your spouse / children (if applicable) are applying for a visa for family reunion.

The paperwork required varies slightly from country to country. Please check if the nearest embassy to your residence offers appointments to apply for visas, and if so, check the earliest possible appointment available. If there is a waiting line of several weeks, please go ahead and book an appointment.

1.       Please collect documents for your visa application. Please make sure you receive an apostille for your documents if required (e.g. often required for marriage certificates). Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions about needed documents / the visa application process.

2.       Kindly let us know which embassy you are contacting, also the date on which you intend to submit your visa application.

3.       Please make sure your passport will not expire in the near future. Kindly make sure that your passport contains blank pages which the German authorities can use for your permit/visa etc.

4.      (If applicable): Please be aware that the German authorities may insist on proof that your spouse has a command of basic German (A1 exam/certificate).  Only if you are granted the status of a highly qualified professional (our assessment from the First step will include your status) your spouse does not have to pass a German exam to be granted a visa and be allowed to enter the country. If your spouse holds a university degree he/she may be released from the obligation to pass a language test.

5.       Time frame: When planning your move to Germany please bear in mind that it may take one month or more for your visa to arrive after your application was submitted. It is therefore of utmost importance that you send us all needed documents in a timely manner and inform us of all developments on your side..

## Third STEP

Submit your visa application(s)

1.      When submitting your application, kindly note your visa application number and provide us with it. This helps us enormously in case we would have to contact the embassy to enquire on your application.

1.      The officer at the embassy receiving your application will usually forward your application to another officer to handle it. Any information to timelines, possible outcomes of the applications etc. may be therefore subject to alterations. We recommend not to start any discussions with the interviewer when handling in your documents.

2.      Kindly give us a feedback of your interview at the embassy and let us know in particular if you are expecting any problems or delays. We will contact the embassy in such a case.

3.     Once the embassy has issued your entry visa(s) please send us a scan.

Please make sure that you are covered by a travel health insurance during the first month of your stay in Germany! You find an information sheet on Travel health insurance enclosed.
