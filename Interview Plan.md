- showcase	experience	delivering	and	managing	big	projects,	dealing	with	low	 and	high	performers,	a	clear	management	philosophy	that	aligns	with	Fb,	 understanding	how	to	make	the	right	org	impact,	and	technical	skills	(sys	 design	is	critical)

## Interview process

- HR screening level
  - Do you meet the base requirements
  - first filter by resume key words, then make sure you meet a base standard
- Junior engineer level
  - Could I work with you - might be direct mentor/peer
  - genuiely interested in them, could be friends after working
- Hiring manager level: management
  - will be able to hit goals without a lot of supervision, 
  - how much efforts do I need to get this person productive
- Senior manager level: culture fit and leadership potential
  - will this person stick long enough with the company and become a leader

## Pre-interview research

- Company's site: culture, product set, and mission for asking specific questions
- Recent news: medium-to-large companies' strategic moves, how will my role support those goals
- Interviewer profile: interviewer's linked profile, blog, twitter



## Psychological Tricks

Here are some psychological tricks that will help you ace a job interview.

- Tailor your answers to the interviewer's age.
  - Generation Y interviewers (between 20 and 30): Bring along visual samples of your work and highlight your ability to multitask.
  - Generation X interviewers (between 30 and 50): Emphasize your creativity and mention how work/life balance contributes to your success.
  - Baby Boomer interviewers (between 50 and 70): Show that you work hard and demonstrate respect for what they've achieved.
- Hold your palms open or steeple your hands.
- Find something in common with your interviewer.
- Mirror the interviewer's body language.
- Compliment the interviewer and the organization without self-promoting.
  - Specifically, the students who ingratiated themselves praised the organization and indicated their enthusiasm for working there, and complimented the interviewer. They didn't play up the value of positive events they took credit for or take credit for positive events even if they weren't solely responsible.
- Show confidence and deference simultaneously.
  - In a job interview, that means showing deference to your interviewer, while also demonstrating self-confidence. One way to do that is to say something like, "I love your work on [whatever area]. It reminds me of my work on [whatever area]."
- Emphasize how you took control of events in your previous jobs.
  - To impress your interviewer, you should talk about past work experiences where you took initiative.
- Be candid about your weaknesses.
  - It's wiser to say something genuine like, "I'm not always the best at staying organized," which sounds more honest, and could make your interviewer more inclined to recommend you for the position.
- Speak expressively.
- Showcase your potential.
  - You might be tempted to tell your interviewer all about your past accomplishments — but research suggests you should focus more on what you could do in the future, if the organization hires you.

# Amazon

## Interview

https://amazon.jobs/en/jobs/1131982/software-development-manager-amazon-search

Software Development Manager - **Amazon Search**

- The phone interview (completed over virtual conference with a team member) focuses on on technical depth, experience delivery products and people/program management. You will not be asked to code for any interview, however you will be requested to design a system from scratch and demonstrate your ability to ask pertinent questions to design an architecture. Most of the interview will ask you behaviorally-based question (“tell me about a time when…”) and will focus on program/people management working across teams to deliver software products.

- 
  For the behavioral questions asked in all interviews it’s highly recommend to prepare examples ahead of time. You can anticipate the area of focus of these using the [Leadership Principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/principles). I recommend reviewing each principle. Consider specific examples from your past or present work experience that align well. Please be prepared to go into detail and consider **what data helped lead to your decisions and results.**

  As you think about examples from your experience, I suggest following the STAR method (see attached). This method will help you organize your thoughts and prepare a structured and concise response to the interviewer’s questions.

  People and/or Program Management – talk about your management experience, your experience in building and growing teams of highly ambitious technical experts, how you help your team members develop, influenced teams without authority, and how you keep them motivated (again, specific examples).
