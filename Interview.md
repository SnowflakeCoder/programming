Our VP Engineering has broken down the various stages of our technical interview process, 

The Interview Process
You will usually go through the following steps during the process:

Initial call with a recruiter (30min)
First tech interview (~1h)
Second tech interview (~1h)
Final bar raiser interview with a senior engineer from another platform (~1h)

Depending on your seniority, role and location there may be additional steps involved. One of the two technical interviews will usually be with a future colleague (Senior or Principal Engineer), the other one will be with a future supervisor (Engineering Manager or Director). The final bar raiser step is performed by a senior engineer/manager from a different part of the Delivery Hero organisation to ensure that people are hired according to the same standards and criteria throughout the company.

We aim to perform all three interviews within a two week period either via phone or if possible, in the office at our Delivery Hero HQ.

When the interview process is finished, you can expect to hear back from us within 5 business days.





Have a solid internet connection. 
Be in a quiet environment, ideally using a headset.
Structure of our Technical Interviews
Each interview contains several sections, for which you can prepare for.

Interviews usually start with a brief introduction to get to know each other better and to understand your current situation and your motivation. It is also quite common to discuss projects you are interested or currently involved in.

As we are all passionate about engineering, every interview process (for all levels, from internships all the way up to our most senior roles) will involve live coding at some point – for up to 30 minutes.

For the remainder of the interview, broader and more in-depth engineering knowledge and experience will be explored. We want to find out what you know and your way of thinking. In this section, topics like architecture, design patterns, technology choices, decision making or development processes are likely to be discussed.

Of course, towards the end of the interview you will have the opportunity to ask any questions that might have been unanswered.

Tips for Live Coding
First of all, it’s important to point out that we know that simple coding tests are not perfect. They cannot 100% accurately predict how you would work on a huge codebase within an international cross functional team, developing a complex feature for millions of daily users. Nevertheless, they have been proven again and again to be helpful in assessing intelligence, communication and problem solving skills – all things that are quite relevant for being a good engineer. 

Interviewers want to enjoy discussing and solving an interesting engineering problem together. To do so, please consider the following hints:

coderpad.io will be used to code together. You could try it here prior to get used to the IDE.
Use the programming language you feel most comfortable in! We want to test your problem solving and fundamental computer science skills (theory, algorithms, complexity, data structures, etc.) and not check frameworks or language specific knowledge. Rare exception might be if the position specifically requires a certain skill.
Talk to the interviewer about what you are doing throughout the live coding, share your thought process. Take your time to think and feel free to ask questions. If you need to be quiet to think, that’s also fine – just let the interviewer know. Listening to other interviews might help you as well: interviewing.io/recordings
Get things done! In the end, we can only evaluate the code you write. If you can think of multiple solutions discuss the preferred approaches with the interviewer, if not just start with a straight forward simple solution and explore how to improve it afterwards.
Avoid Trial-and-Error coding. During the development you should not execute your code ongoingly, but rather wait until you think it’s good to run it. And if there are bugs, that’s not a problem at all but a good chance to show your debugging skills.
Practice! Even experienced senior engineers can get a little rusty at quickly coding an algorithm solving a small math problem, as this is not what you or engineers at Delivery Hero do on a daily basis. Therefore we recommend to spend some time on sites like careercup.com, projecteuler.net, hackerrank.com or topcoder.com to get yourself comfortable with solving problems under time constraints. To practice daily you can subscribe to the newsletter dailycodingproblem.com. If you prefer a good book, check out Cracking the Coding Interview.
Complexity of algorithms might come up. So quickly read up again what O(nlogn) means.
And last but not least “You are not your code!“. Even if the process might not be successful this time, you will hopefully have met great people and learned something. In any case we will always treat you fairly and with the highest respect, hoping that we can work together in the future.

*Spark Networks SE* is a leading global dating company with a widening portfolio of premium & freemium apps. Listed on the New York Stock Exchange American under the ticker symbol ‘LOV’, the company was formed in 2017 following the merger between Berlin-based *Affinitas GmbH* and US-based *Spark Networks Inc*. From small start-up to the world’s 2nd largest publicly listed dating company with over one million monthly paying subscribers, Spark’s success story is nothing short of remarkable.

*Spark Networks Inc.* began with **Jdate**, a niche dating site for the Jewish community, launched out of a West Los Angeles condominium in 1997. Word spread fast, and it quickly became the go-to destination for Jewish singles looking for love worldwide. Successful religious dating ventures followed, including **Christian Mingle**, the app synonymous with Christian dating in the US, as well as **LDS Singles** and **Adventist Singles**. An acquisition saw the popular millennial Jewish dating app, **JSwipe**, added to the portfolio in 2015.

Meanwhile, across the Atlantic Ocean, venture capitalists were investing in Berlin start-up *Affinitas GmbH*. Their first app, **eDarling**, launched in 2009 in Germany, and expanded internationally the following year. Eyeing rapid growth, eHarmony invested in the company in 2010, only to sell their stake back to existing shareholders in 2013. But *Affinitas GmbH* wasn’t disheartened; it saw opportunity.

The buy-back allowed the company to enter the lucrative English-speaking markets, which was previously barred by its relationship with eHarmony. **EliteSingles**, an app for educated singles and professionals, launched in the UK, Canada and Australia in 2013 and in the US in late 2015. EliteSingles enjoyed unprecedented success and became *Affinitas*’ flagship app. The acquisition of **Attractive World** followed in 2016, propelling the company’s position in France.

In November 2017, *Affinitas GmbH* and *Spark Networks Inc.* closed an all-stock merger that led to the creation of a new parent company, *Spark Networks SE,* heralding a bold new chapter and an increased presence in the US – the company’s key market. The following year Spark re-launched **SilverSingles**, a premium dating app for 50+ dating, which continues to see strong commercial success. Spark further consolidated its portfolio in July 2019 when it acquired **Zoosk,** marking a two fold increase in scale and making *Spark Networks SE* the second largest dating company in North America.

Amazon Web Services Talks To Spark CTO, Ben Hoskins, About Migrating To The Cloud

[PDF Version](https://www.spark.net/node/13476/pdf)

When Affinitas merged with Spark Networks Inc. in 2017, our portfolio expanded from three to nine apps overnight. These apps spanned various technology platforms, for which our existing data center setup simply wasn’t sufficient, so our CTO, Ben Hoskins, set to work devising a way to build out a new platform. It was a daunting task, but necessary if we wanted to effectively and efficiently manage so many diverse properties.

*Amazon Web Services* spoke to Ben about how migrating to the cloud was the answer.

**Looking For Love In The Cloud**

*Spark had been beset by long and repeated data center outages due to outdated hardware and multiple services running on the same physical servers with little virtualization or isolation. This prevented the operations team from detecting and resolving issues effectively.* *“The data center that we were in wasn't fit for purpose,” Hoskins says. “Data, for us, is a main driver for business success and we couldn't even guarantee that it would be available. It made zero sense for us to run our business that way, so I proposed that we move our platform into the cloud.”*

*Most of Spark’s dating sites are based on the Affinitas web platform, which is a 10-year old Java system with too many stored procedures (which means that it wasn’t suited to the cloud). Replacing it was a long-term project, but Hoskins was keen to migrate operations to the cloud as quickly as possible. “We knew AWS was going to help us launch new products in a more efficient and cost-effective way,” he explains.*

- cut release time by 300 percent
- drop page load times by 75%
- shipped new features without customer-facing downtime
