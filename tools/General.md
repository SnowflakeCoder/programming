## NoSQL Database

A NoSQL database is a database that provides a **mechanism to store and retrieve data** other than the **tabular relations used in relational databases**. These databases are **schema-free**, support **easy replication**, have **simple API**, **eventually consistent**, and can handle **huge amounts of data**. NoSql databases **use different data structures** compared to relational databases. It makes some operations faster in NoSQL. The primary objective of a NoSQL database is to have

- simplicity of design,
- horizontal scaling, and
- finer control over availability.

### NoSQL vs. Relational Database

| Relational Database                                          | NoSql Database                          |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Supports powerful query language.                            | Supports very simple query language.    |
| It has a **fixed schema**.                                   | No fixed schema.                        |
| Follows **ACID** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and  Durability). | It is only “**eventually consistent**”. |
| Supports transactions.                                       | Does not support transactions.          |

**Apache HBase** - HBase is an open source, non-relational, **distributed database** modeled after **Google’s BigTable** and is **written in Java**. It is developed as a part of **Apache Hadoop project** and **runs on top of HDFS**, providing BigTable-like capabilities for Hadoop.

**MongoDB** - MongoDB is a **cross-platform document-oriented database** system that uses **JSON-like documents** with **dynamic schemas** making the integration of data easier and faster.
