## How S/W Engg process works

Here's how a software engineering process works in a Product based company.

1. The product management team does **market research** and creates new Product requirements in the pipeline
2. Engineering team reviews the requirements, does **feasibility analysis** then creates HLD(High-level design)
3. 3rd party dependencies, inter-team dependencies, etc identified
4. Once HLD is agreed upon by stakeholders, creates LLD(Low-level design)
5. Language choice, frameworks, minor details are fixed
6. QA, Dev, Ops, Performance team members identified by Project management
7. Engg. starts POC (Proof of concept) of various components.
8. Code repositories created and CI/CD pipelines built.
9. Requirements are broken into **smaller deliverable features** and committed to Product management with timelines.
10. Actual coding starts in iterations.
11. Each iteration has a lifecycle of Dev, QA, Performance, Integration, Stage.
12. Once code reaches production servers the maintenance, log string monitoring, load monitoring, release management kicks in.
13. Continuous delivery of triaged bugs and features in iterations follow.
