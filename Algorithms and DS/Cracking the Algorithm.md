# The Interview Process

You should do your best to <u>talk out loud throughout the problem</u> and <u>explain your thought process</u>. Your interviewer might jump in sometimes to help you; It's normal and doesn't really mean that you're doing poorly. Your interviewer will make an assessment of your performance, usually based on the following:

- #### Analytical skills

  - Did you need much help solving the problem? 
  - How optimal was your solution? 
  - How long did it take you to arrive at a solution? 
  - If you had to design/ architect a new solution, did you structure the problem well and think through the tradeoffs of different decisions?

- #### Coding skills

  - Were you able to successfully translate your algorithm to reasonable code? 
  - Was it clean and well-organized? Did you think about potential errors? 
  - Did you use good style?

- #### Technical knowledge / Computer Science fundamentals

  - Do you have a strong foundation in computer science and the relevant technologies?

- #### Experience

  - Have you made good technical decisions in the past? Have you built interesting, challenging projects? Have you shown drive, initiative, and other important factors?

- #### Culture fit / Communication skills

  - Do your personality and values fit with the company and team? Did you communicate well with your interviewer?

The weighting of these areas will vary based on the question, interviewer, role, team, and company. In a standard algorithm question, it might be almost entirely the first three of those.

## Interview Methods - Why?

**False negatives are acceptable**

From the company's perspective, it's actually <u>acceptable that some good candidates are rejected</u>. The company can accept that they miss out on some good people. They'd prefer not to, of course, as it raises their recruiting costs. It is an acceptable tradeoff, though, provided they can still hire enough good people. They're far **more concerned with false positives**: people who do well in an interview but are not in fact very good.

**Problem-solving skills are valuable**
If you're able to work through several hard problems, you're probably pretty good at developing optimal algorithms. You're smart and tend to do good things, and that's valuable at a company.

**Basic data structure and algorithm knowledge is useful**
It's very difficult to know that you should use a binary search tree if you don't know of its existence. And if you do know of its existence, then you pretty much know the basics.
Other interviewers justify the reliance on data structures and algorithms by arguing that **it's a good "proxy:'**, they say it's reasonably **well-correlated with being a good developer**. It means that you've either gone through a computer science program or learned this stuff on your own. Either way, it's a good sign. Also it's <u>hard to ask problem-solving questions that don't involve data structure and algorithm knowledge</u>.

**Whiteboards let you focus on what matters**

It's true that you'd struggle with writing perfect code on a whiteboard. Everyone has some bugs or minor syntactical errors. But you can focus on the big picture. You don't need to make your code compile. You don't need to write the entire class definition and boilerplate code. You get to <u>focus on the interesting, "meaty" parts of the code</u>. Whiteboards also tend to encourage candidates to speak more and explain their thought process.

## It's All Relative

If there's no grading system, how are you evaluated? How does an interviewer know what to expect of you? Interviewers **assess you relative to other candidates** on that same question by the same interviewer. It's a **relative comparison**. Your interviewer develops a feel for your performance by **comparing you to other people**. For this reason, getting a hard question isn't a bad thing. When it's harder for you, it's harder for everyone.

# Behind the Scenes

How companies interview and what they're looking for?

- Once you are selected for an interview, you usually go through a **screening interview**. The "screening" interview often involves coding and algorithms questions, and the bar can be just as high as it is for in-person interviews. Many companies have taken advantage of **online synchronized document editors**, but others will expect you to write code on paper and read it back over the phone. Some interviewers may even give you "homework" to solve after you hang up the phone or just ask you to email them the code you wrote.
- In an **on-site interview round**, you usually have 3 to 6 in-person interviews. Interviews will be mostly technical and will involve a combination of coding, algorithm, design/architecture, and behavioral/experience questions.

## The Microsoft Interview

Microsoft wants smart people. Geeks. People who are passionate about technology. You will be expected to write code on the board. You'll have a **short interview with a recruiter** who will give you a sample question. Your <u>recruiter is usually there to prep you</u>, not to grill you on technical questions. If you get asked some basic technical questions, it may be because your recruiter wants to ease you into the interview so that you're less nervous when the "real" interview starts.
**Be nice to your recruiter**. Your recruiter can be **your biggest advocate**, even pushing to re-interview you if you stumbled on your first interview. They can **fight for you to be hired-or not**! 

During the day, you'll do four or five interviews, often with two different teams. Unlike many companies, where you meet your interviewers in a conference room, <u>you'll meet with your Microsoft interviewers in their office</u>. This is a great time to look around and get a feel for the team culture.

**Definitely Prepare**: "Why do you want to work for Microsoft?"
In this question, <u>Microsoft wants to see that you're passionate about technology</u>. A great answer might be, "I've been using Microsoft software as long as I can remember, and I'm really impressed at how Microsoft manages to create a product that is universally excellent. For example, I've been using Visual Studio recently to learn game programming, and its APls are excellent:' Note how this shows a passion for technology!

## The Amazon Interview

Amazon's recruiting process typically **begins with a phone screen** in which a candidate interviews with a specific team. A small portion of the time, a candidate may have two or more interviews, which can indicate either that one of their interviewers wasn't convinced or that they are being considered for a different team or profile. In more unusual cases, such as when a candidate is local or has recently interviewed for a different position, a candidate may only do one phone screen.

The engineer who interviews you will usually ask you to **write simple code via a shared document editor**. They will also often ask a broad set of questions to **explore what areas of technology you're familiar with**. Next, You will have to code on a whiteboard, and some interviewers will stress other skills. Interviewers are each assigned a specific area to probe and may seem very different from each other. <u>They cannot see the other feedback until they have submitted their own, and they are discouraged from discussing it</u> until the hiring meeting. 

The **"bar raiser" interviewer** is charged with keeping the interview bar high. They <u>attend special training</u> and will interview candidates outside their group in order to balance out the group itself. <u>If one interview seems significantly harder and different</u>, that's most likely the bar raiser. This person has both significant experience with interviews and veto power in the hiring decision. Remember <u>your performance is judged relative to other candidates</u>; it's not evaluated on a simple "percent correct" basis.
**Definitely Prepare:**
Amazon cares a lot about scale. Make sure you **prepare for scalability questions**. Additionally, Amazon tends to ask a lot of questions about **object-oriented design**. 

The Bar Raiser is brought in from a different team to keep the bar high. You need to impress both this person and the hiring manager.

## The Google Interview

A Google engineer performs the **first phone screen**, so expect tough technical questions. These questions may involve coding, sometimes via a shared document. Candidates are typically **held to the same standard** and are **asked similar questions on phone screens** as in on-site interviews. On your on-site interview, you'll interview with four to six people, one of whom will be a **lunch interviewer**. Interviewer feedback is kept confidential from the other interviewers, so you can be assured that you enter each interview with blank slate. Your lunch interviewer doesn't submit feedback, so this is a great opportunity to ask honest questions.

Interviewers are typically **not given specific focuses**, and there is no "structure" or "system" as to what you're asked when. Each interviewer can conduct the interview however she would like.
<u>Written feedback is submitted</u> to a hiring committee (HC) of engineers and managers to make a hire /no-hire recommendation. Feedback is typically broken down into **four categories** (Analytical Ability, Coding, Experience, and Communication) and you are given an overall score from 1.0 to 4.0. To extend an offer, the HC <u>wants to see at least one interviewer who is an "enthusiastic endorser:'</u> In other words, a packet with scores of 3.6,3.1,3.1 and 2.6 is better than all 3.1 s.

You do not necessarily need to excel in every interview, and your <u>phone screen performance is usually not a strong factor</u> in the final decision. 

**Definitely Prepare:**
As a web-based company, Google cares about **how to design a scalable system**. So you prepare
for questions from **System Design and Scalability**. Google puts a <u>strong focus on analytical (algorithm) skills</u>, regardless of experience. You should be very well prepared for these questions.

## The Apple Interview

The interviewers will be looking for **excellent technical skills**, but a passion for the position and the company is also very important. While it's not a prerequisite to be a Mac user, you should **at least be familiar with the system**.

The interview process usually begins with a **recruiter phone screen** to get a basic sense of your skills, followed up by a series of technical phone screens with team members. Once you're invited, the recruiter provides an overview of the process. You will then have 6-8 interviews. You can expect a mix of one-on-one and two-on-one interviews. Be ready to **code on a whiteboard** and make sure **all of your thoughts are clearly communicated**. Lunch is with your potential future manager and appears more casual, but it is still an interview. Each interviewer usually **focuses on a different area** and is discouraged from sharing feedback with other interviewers unless there's something they want subsequent interviewers to drill into.
**Definitely Prepare:**
If you know what team you're interviewing with, **make sure you read up on that product**. What do you like about it? What would you improve? Offering specific recommendations can show your passion for the job.
**What's Unique:**
Apple does **two-on-one interviews often**, but don't get stressed out about them- it's the same as a one-on-one interview. Also, Apple employees are **huge Apple fans**. You should show this same passion in your interview.

## The Facebook Interview

Once selected for an interview, candidates will generally do one or two phone screens. Phone screens will
be technical and will involve coding, usually an online document editor.
After the phone interview(s), you might be asked to do a homework assignment that will include a mix of
coding and algorithms. Pay attention to your coding style here. If you've never worked in an environment
which had thorough code reviews, it may be a good idea to get someone who has to review your code.
During your on-site interview, you will interview primarily with other software engineers, but hiring
managers are also involved whenever they are available. All interviewers have gone through comprehensive
interview training, and who you interview with has no bearing on your odds of getting an offer.
Each interviewer is given a "role" during the on-site interviews, which helps ensure that there are no repetitive
questions and that they get a holistic picture of a candidate. These roles are:
• Behavioral ("Jedi"): This interview assesses your ability to be successful in Facebook's environment.
Would you fit well with the culture and values? What are you excited about? How do you tackle challenges?
Be prepared to talk about your interest in Facebook as well. Facebook wants passionate people.
You might also be asked some coding questions in this interview.
• Coding and Algorithms ("Ninja"): These are your standard coding and algorithms questions, much like
what you'll find in this book. These questions are designed to be challenging. You can use any programming
language you want.
12 Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition
III Behind the Scenes
• Design/Architecture ("Pirate"): For a backend software engineer, you might be asked system design
questions. Front-end or other specialties will be asked design questions related to that discipline. You
should openly discuss different solutions and their tradeoffs.
You can typically expect two "ninja" interviews and one "jedi" interview. Experienced candidates will also
usually get a "pirate" interview.
After your interview, interviewers submit written feedback, prior to discussing your performance with each
other. This ensures that your performance in one interview will not bias another interviewer's feedback.
Once everyone's feedback is submitted, your interviewing team and a hiring manager get together to
collaborate on a final decision. They come to a consensus decision and submit a final hire recommendation
to the hiring committee.
Definitely Prepare:
The youngest of the "elite" tech companies, Facebook wants developers with an entrepreneurial spirit. In
your interviews, you should show that you love to build stuff fast.
They want to know you can hack together an elegant and scalable solution using any language of choice.
Knowing PHP is not especially important, particularly given that Facebook also does a lot of backend work
in C++, Python, Erlang, and other languages.
What's Unique:
Facebook interviews developers for the company "in general:' not for a specific team. If you are hired, you
will go through a six-week "bootcamp" which will help ramp you up in the massive code base. You'll get
mentorship from senior devs, learn best practices, and, ultimately, get a greater flexibility in choosing a
project than if you were assigned to a project in your interview.

## The Palantir Interview

Unlike some companies which do "pooled" interviews (where you interview with the company as a whole,
not with a specific team), Palantir interviews for a specific team. Occasionally, your application might be
re-routed to another team where there is a better fit.
The Palantir interview process typically starts with two phone interviews. These interviews are about 30 to
45 minutes and will be primarily technical. Expect to cover a bit about your prior experience, with a heavy
focus on algorithm questions.
You might also be sent a HackerRank coding assessment, which will evaluate your ability to write optimal
algorithms and correct code. Less experienced candidates, such as those in college, are particularly likely
to get such a test.
After this, successful candidates are invited to campus and will interview with up to five people. Onsite
interviews cover your prior experience, relevant domain knowledge, data structures and algorithms, and
design.
You may also likely get a demo of Palantir's products. Ask good questions and demonstrate your passion
for the company.
After the interview, the interviewers meet to discuss your feedback with the hiring manager.

III Behind the Scenes
Definitely Prepare:
Palantir values hiring brilliant engineers. Many candidates report that Palantir's questions were harder than
those they saw at Google and other top companies. This doesn't necessarily mean it's harder to get an offer
(although it certainly can); it just means interviewers prefer more challenging questions. If you're interviewing
with Palantir, you should learn your core data structures and algorithms inside and out. Then, focus
on preparing with the hardest algorithm questions.
Brush up on system design too if you're interviewing for a backend role. This is an important part of the
process.
What's Unique:
A coding challenge is a common part of Palantir's process. Although you'll be at your computer and can
look up material as needed, don't walk into this unprepared. The questions can be extremely challenging
and the efficiency of your algorithm will be evaluated. Thorough interview preparation will help you here.
You can also practice coding challenges online at HackerRank.com.

# Special Situations

## Experienced Candidates

More experienced engineers might see slightly less focus on algorithm questions. System design and architecture questions, as well as questions about your resume. Your performance in such interview questions would be evaluated with respect to your experience level. Experienced candidates will be expected to give a more in-depth, impressive response to questions like, "What was the hardest bug you've faced?" You have more experience, and your response to these questions should show it.

## Product (and Program) Management

<u>PMs may spend much of their day coding</u>. Generally speaking, interviewers for PM positions are looking for candidates to demonstrate skills in the following areas:

- **Handling Ambiguity**: This is typically not a critical area for an interview, but interviewers do look for skill here. <u>When faced with an ambiguous situation, you don't get overwhelmed and stall</u>. They want to see you **tackle the problem head on**: <u>seeking new information, prioritizing the most important parts, and solving the problem</u> in a structured way.
- Customer Focus (Attitude): Interviewers want to see that your **attitude is customer-focused**. Do you assume that everyone will use the product just like you do? Or are you the type of person who puts himself in the customer's shoes and tries to understand how they want to use the product? Questions like "Design an alarm clock for the blind" are ripe for examining this aspect. **Be sure to ask a lot of questions** to understand who the customer is and how they are using the product. The skills covered in the Testing section are closely related to this.
- **Multi-Level Communication**: PMs need to be able to communicate with people at all levels, across many positions and ranges of technical skills. Your interviewer will want to see that you possess this **flexibility in your communication**. This is often examined directly, through a question such as, "**Explain TCP/IP to your grandmother**:'Your communication skills may also be **assessed by how you discuss your prior projects**.
- Passion for Technology: **Happy employees are productive employees**, so a company wants to make sure that you'll **enjoy the job** and be **excited about your work**. Questions like, "**Why are you interested in Microsoft?**" Interviewers will look for <u>enthusiasm in how you discuss your prior experience</u> and how you <u>discuss the team's challenges</u>. They want to see that you will be eager to face the job's challenges.
- **Teamwork / Leadership**: Most important aspect of the interview, looking for your **ability to work well with other people**. Most commonly assessed with questions like, "Tell me about a time when a teammate wasn't pulling his / her own weight:' Your interviewer is looking to see that you **handle conflicts well**, that **you take initiative**, that **you understand people**, and that **people like working with you**. Your work preparing for behavioral questions will be extremely important here.

## Dev Lead and Managers

Strong coding skills are almost always required for dev lead positions and often for management positions as well. Make sure to be **very strong with coding and algorithms**. Google, in particular, holds managers to high standards when it comes to coding. In addition, prepare to be examined for skills in the following areas:

- Teamwork / Leadership: Anyone in a management-like role needs to be able to **both lead and work with people**. You will be examined implicitly and explicitly in these areas. Explicit evaluation will come in the form of asking you <u>how you handled prior situations</u>, such as when you disagreed with a manager. The implicit evaluation comes in the form of your interviewers watching how you interact with them. If you come off as <u>too arrogant or too passive</u>, your interviewer may feel you aren't great as a manager.
- Prioritization: Managers are often faced with tricky issues, such as **how to make sure a team meets a tough deadline**, that you can prioritize a project appropriately, **cutting the less important aspects**. Prioritization means asking the right questions to understand **what is critical and what you can reasonably expect** to accomplish.
- Communication: Managers need to communicate with people both above and below them, and potentially with customers and other much less technical people. Interviewers will look to see that **you can communicate at many levels** in a way that is friendly and engaging. This is an evaluation of your personality.
- "Getting Things Done": This means striking the right balance between preparing for a project and actually implementing it. You need to understand **how to structure a project** and **how to motivate people** so you can accomplish the team's goals.

## For Interviewers

### Avoid "scary" questions.

find all positive integer solutions under 1,000 to a3 + b3 = c3 + d3 (page 68).
They need to understand the concept of <u>exponents, sums, and equality</u>, and that's it. This sounds like a math problem. It's not. It's an **algorithm question**' 

Other questions might involve a bit of **probability**. e.g. to pick between five options, pick a random number between 1 and 5.

### Probe deeper on behavioral questions.

Many candidates are **poor at articulating their specific accomplishments**. You ask them a question about a challenging situation, and they tell you about a **difficult situation their**
**team faced**. Don't assume that a candidate didn't do much in a situation just because you have **trouble understanding what they did**. Ask them specifically if they can tell you what their role was. Ask them to go into more details about **how they thought about the issue** and the **different steps they took**. Ask them **why they took certain actions**. Not describing the details of the actions they took makes them a flawed candidate, but not necessarily a flawed employee.

### Coach your candidates.

How candidates can develop good algorithms. When you do this; you're separating interview skills from job skills.

- Many candidates <u>don't use an example to solve an interview question</u> (or they don't use a good example). This makes it substantially **more difficult to develop a solution**. Some candidates take a <u>long time to find the bug because they use an enormous example</u>. They didn't realize that it would be **more efficient to analyze their code conceptually first**, or that a small example would work nearly as well.

**Know your mode**: At a very high level, there are **four modes of questions**:

- **Sanity Check**: These are often <u>easy problem-solving or design questions</u>, use them to filter out the worst candidates. They won't tell distinguish between "okay" versus "great'.
- **Quality Check**: These are the **more challenging questions**, often in problem-solving or design. They are designed to be rigorous and **really make a candidate think**.
- **Specialist Questions**: These questions test knowledge of specific topics, such as Java or machine learning. 
- **Proxy Knowledge**: This is knowledge that is not quite at the specialist level (in fact, you might not even need it), but that you would expect a candidate at their level to know. For example, it might not be very important to you if a candidate knows C5S or HTML.
