# Kotlin

Modern programming languages are developed to take the full advantages of modern computer hardware (Multi-Core CPU, GPU, TPU), mobile devices, large-set of data, fast networking, Container, and Cloud. Also, most of the modern programming languages offer much **higher developer Ergonomics** as given below:

- Concise and terse code (less boilerplate coding)
- Built-in support for concurrency
- Null pointer safety
- Type Inference
- The much simpler feature set
- Lower cognitive load
- Blending the best features of all programming paradigms

## Introduction

Java is the undisputed king of **Enterprise Software Development**. In recent times, Java has become the target of much criticism: It is verbose, needs **lots of boilerplate coding**, prone to accidental complexity. 

Over the years, JVM languages like **Scala** tried to answer the shortcomings of Java and wanted to be better Java but failed. Finally, <u>Jet Brains has developed Kotlin</u>, which **runs on JVM** and answers the shortcomings of Java and offered many modern features. The best part is that unlike Scala, **Kotlin is much simpler** than Java and offers Go or Python-like developer productivity in JVM.

Google has declared Kotlin as a first-class language to develop **Android** and boosted Kotlin’s acceptance in the community. Also popular **Java Enterprise framework Spring** has started to support Kotlin in the Spring eco-system since 2017. I have used <u>Kotlin with Reactive Spring</u> and the experience was amazing.

**Main Features:**

- The USP of Kotlin is its **language design**. I always view Kotlin as Go/Python on JVM because of its clean, concise code. As a result, Kotlin is highly productive.
- Like many other modern languages, Kotlin offers features like <u>Null pointer safety, Type Inference</u>.
- As Kotlin also runs in JVM, you can use the existing huge eco-system of Java libraries.
- Kotlin is a **first-class language to develop Android App** and has already surpassed Java as the number one programming language to develop Android App.
- Kotlin is backed by JetBrains and Open Source. So, Kotlin has excellent tooling support.
- There are two interesting projects: **Kotlin Native** (to compile Kotlin into native code) and **kotlin.js** (Kotlin to JavaScript). If they become successful, then Kotlin can be used outside JVM.
- Kotlin also offers a simple way to write **DSL** (Domain Specific Language)



Kotlin is a general-purpose programming language with type inference. It is designed to be completely interoperable with Java. Moreover, from the time Android announced it as its first language, Kotlin offers features that developers ask for. It effortlessly combines object-oriented and functional programming features within it.



The effortless interoperation between Java and Kotlin makes Android development faster and enjoyable. Since Kotlin addresses the major issues surfaced in Java, several Java apps are rewritten in Kotlin. For instance, brands like Coursera and Pinterest have already moved to Kotlin due to strong tooling support. 

As most businesses move to Kotlin, Google is bound to promote this language more than Java. Hence, Kotlin has a strong future in the Android app development ecosystem.

Kotlin is an easy-to-learn, open-source, and swift language for Android app development that removes any adoption-related barriers. You can use it for Android development, web development, desktop development, and server-side development. Therefore, it’s a must-learn language for programmers and Android app developers in 2020.
