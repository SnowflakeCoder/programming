# Zalando

## Code challenge

you might have a quick one hour interview after your code challenge has been submitted to **discuss your solution**.

Read up a little on better **git commit message standards**.

- 
  Basic project/framework setup
  - Say if you are a go developer and you are applying for backend developer positions, then **practice writing api servers with it**. Have a **set template ready with you** so that you can quickly refer to when you have doubts. 
- Unit/functional Tests
  - Same applies here. You can **quickly refer how you wrote tests** to simply write tests for your project. We are actually living in an era where **not writing tests is simply unacceptable**. So my advice on this would be to <u>really practice writing unit tests. 
- Code organization/**Design patterns**
  - There is ideally no right way, but having a particular path is always good. eg, if you are not a bit fan of OOPS and want more FP, then you can simply organize your code in such a way that <u>you do not have a lot of mutations in your classes</u> and simply have helper singleton functions. 
- Containerize
  - Since you probably would be building a full fledged project which your future employer is gonna evaluate on their machines. You can <u>add docker files to your projects</u> so that the reviewer can <u>setup your project hassle free</u>.

## Onsite Interview

This will be a deeper technical interview and could even be some pair programming challenges.

Studying on particular languages, its Garbage collection strategies, algorithms,

## Interview

- When you will choose monolith over microservices
- What are rest apis? how are they documented? Design a rest api 
- Create a singleton impl 
- How to have a synchronized counter
- What design patterns are you aware of and use frequently

- Create a pascal triangle of size n 

### system design

- System design for one of Zalando services.
- System Design: add additional components and explain how they will act in existing ecosystem.

### behavioral

- Behavioural questions about managing a team, motivating them, conflicts, new process introducing.
- Describe your biggest work failure. 
- whats your weakness, strength, your last achievement your last fail etc. 
- why do you want to work for us,

General structure of all mentioned interviews and what to prepare well described in **Cracking Code Interview book**.



 Reading data from file and aggregating/grouping and transforming  

Maximum sum sub sequence/dynamic programming

Given a string of numbers reverse it and return an integer 

An sql query using not in operator



 What's new in Java 8 is most useful.
\- Idea of microservices
\- Explain dependency injection in Spring
\- Implement algorithm that check if number is a prime number  

Tell me one thing that you resume does not tell 

 Databases questions with SQL task

asked many Operations questions such like Kubernetes.

Remeber your codility solutions and try to improve it during the interview . 



Q.) Parse file directories to a tree structure
2.)Prime numbers till n
3.)Print a table based on List of Maps  



What would your former employer say are your weaknesses?  

REST full API design  

find total # of numbers that satisfy x*(x+1) that fall within a and b (a, b, x all integers and a<=b) 

JVM Garbage collections technique.  

Detailed explanation of HashMap

\- REST, REST vs SOAP
\- Are you familiar with Circuit breakers, retries..

system design and performance optimizations

get function complexity of HashMap?  

 Given a array of integers find the index which partitions the array to two with high numbers and low numbers. For example [5, -1, 3, 8,6] the index 3 will partition the array to [5,-1,3] and [8,6] all the numbers in the second partition are greater than first. The solution has to work in O(n).  



Microservices
Run-length encoding ( "aaabb" => "a3b2" )
Path simplifier ( "/home/user1/..//user2/./dog/" => "/home/user2/dog" )
Scala future convertion ( def convert(input: List[Future[Int]]): Future[List[Int]] = ??? )
Pascal triangle ( def pascal(size: Int): List[List[Int]] = ???
