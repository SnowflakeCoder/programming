# Zalando

## Code challenge

you might have a quick one hour interview after your code challenge has been submitted to **discuss your solution**.

Read up a little on better **git commit message standards**.

- 
  Basic project/framework setup
  - Say if you are a go developer and you are applying for backend developer positions, then **practice writing api servers with it**. Have a **set template ready with you** so that you can quickly refer to when you have doubts. 
- Unit/functional Tests
  - Same applies here. You can **quickly refer how you wrote tests** to simply write tests for your project. We are actually living in an era where **not writing tests is simply unacceptable**. So my advice on this would be to <u>really practice writing unit tests. 
- Code organization/**Design patterns**
  - There is ideally no right way, but having a particular path is always good. eg, if you are not a bit fan of OOPS and want more FP, then you can simply organize your code in such a way that <u>you do not have a lot of mutations in your classes</u> and simply have helper singleton functions. 
- Containerize
  - Since you probably would be building a full fledged project which your future employer is gonna evaluate on their machines. You can <u>add docker files to your projects</u> so that the reviewer can <u>setup your project hassle free</u>.

## Onsite Interview

This will be a deeper technical interview and could even be some pair programming challenges.
