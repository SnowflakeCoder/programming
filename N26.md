What you know about the position?  





There are four rounds and one task in total.

The first round was a screening call with some case questions. The questions involves calculation and logical thinking. They are not too difficult but still you need immediate reaction to them. Then the interviewer asked me to do a small task regarding the competitive analysis. After that I received a notice saying the work was great and would like to continue the process.

The 2nd and 3rd interviews were with another two product managers and they all left me good impression. The interview questions were very interesting. They were not difficult but surely you have to already have some ideas in your mind. You should be able to explain your idea well and logical.

The final round was a short call with their C-level. Unfortunately it's not very well-organized and was rescheduled several times. There was a miscommunication about how they made call. On time it was canceled without an early notice and I just waited there online. It's understandable but surely doesn't leave positive impression and that's why I put my experience as neutral only. The last call was rather short, which is also fine. But it seems that the interviewer was in a rush and couldn't wait to end the call. I could feel that he wanted to finish the call so he could just send me a rejection after several reschedules. So I know they would send me the rejection in one day and they did.

Overall, if you want to prepare well you definitely have to understand and use their products. Also, it's important you show your knowledge, opinion and passion about product management and their business. It surely is a company with great products.
